# Nesia the chatbot

## Proof of concept: Incorporating AI solutions into the Upsouth platform

---

### **Overview**

In this first development cycle of it's kind for the Upsouth platform. The development team for 2023 will demonstrate a proof-of-concept chatbot that provides assistance to youth users on the Up South web application. The chatbot will focus on guiding users through the signup process, facilitating login procedures, and assisting with creating posts and the rules and guidelines. The goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the chatbot concept by seamlessly integrating it into a mock-up web application.

We will be utilizing the vast services the AWS have to offer. In particular building the chatbot with Amazon Lex, integrating with AWS-SDK and an NodeJS Express API, and a customized User Interface created on a ReactJS frontend.
